# Using er9x #

Currently the best first step you can take in using er9x is to read the manual!

This can be download as a PDF file from:

The guide is being updated all the time, so do go back to it once and a while for a review.

richardmrazek (youtube user) has created a range of youtube guides that are superb.  These guides can be found on:

Please note that the software is continually evolving and it is quite possible that if you are on a different firmware version, some details will have changed.
