# EXPO D/R (3/6) #
Edit Expo values and D/R.

Use U/D/L/R keys to navigate.
As a rule the values are set for **both** sides if they are equal.  To set Left/Right separately either move the stick to one side or enter the "Edit Single Expo" screen.

exp  -> Expo value
%    -> Weight.
sw1 -> switch to select High/Med values.
sw2 -> Switch to select Med/Low values.   If sw1 is high then this has no effect.
> Example - to select the 3-position switch for triple rates choose: sw1=!ID0, sw2=!ID1

Pressing Long Menu will enter the "Edit Single Expo" Screen.
This screen has a graphical representation of the expo/dr.  To set L/R move the stick.


~Switches can be normal or reversed.  By pressing left you can see the following notation: !THR.  That means THR switch in reverse.
