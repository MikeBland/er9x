# Why use er9x? #

The big thing about the er9x based radios is the price.  Typically they can be purchased for around $60 + shipping.  For this you get a fairly well build 9 channel transmitter.  Much cheaper than most of the leading brands!

Whats the catch?  (there is always one)

The stock firmware while effective at what is does is less than perfect.  It has bugs, inconsistant navigation and is very slow to navigate around.

Er9x on the otherhand is a lightweight super streamlined system that will turn your 'cheap' radio into something that can compete easily with the high end system.  In many cases outperforming them!

A few key benifits of the system are:

  * Up to 16 model memories.
  * Multilevel flexible mixer - any input channel can be assigned to any output.
  * Mixers can be added, multiplied or set to replace other mixers.
  * 8 5pt curves, 8 9pt curves with graphic visualization.
  * Expo and Dr for the 4 primary channels, split Left/Right with graphic visualization.
  * Throttle trim, throttle expo.
  * PPM input from the trainer port can be used as input to mixer.
  * Adjustable timer for each model. Can be activated by switches, throttle channel or throttle %.
  * Adjustable battery warning voltage.
  * Adjustable contrast.
  * Adjustable beeper.
  * Selectable trim increments.
  * Selectable PPM output - 4ch, 6ch, 8ch, 10ch, 12ch, 14ch, 16ch.
  * Selectable PPM pulse spacing.
  * Limits and offsets for each output channel.
  * Offset can be set with stick inputs.
  * Stick calibration.
  * Graphic or numerical representation of output values.
  * Throttle tracing.
  * Reverse throttle.

As an added bonus for thos who are so inclined, a number of variants of the firmware exist that will enable you (with a little soldering) to turn your er9x radio into a full telemetry enabled system!

Not bad for a $60 TX from China!
