The Eurgle/FlySky/Imax/Turnigy 9x r/c Transmitter is a nicely built unit basically copied from a more recognized manufacturer.

The unit itself hosts an Atmel AtMega64 8-bit MCU. The hardware includes 2 sticks, 3 potentiometers and 7 switches. It also supports a 128x64px screen without a back light.

This project replaces the software that comes with the standard transmitter with a more powerful and flexible version.

Some of the many improvements are: Up to 16 Models in memory Up to 16 output channels Multi-level mixes Any function can be assigned to any output 5pt and 9pt curves, variable sound, frsky telemetry support and much much more!

This project is based on the th9x project. http://code.google.com/p/th9x/
