# Flashing the 9x transmitter #

By far the easiest way to flash your radio with a new firmware is to purchase the smartie parts programmer and back light kit.

This can be purchased for around $40 and is pretty much gauranteed to get you up and running in next to no time.  As an added bonus you get a EL backlight for your radio at the same time!

Have a look at the following guide and reviews and you will see just how easy it is!
